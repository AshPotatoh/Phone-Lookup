# Phone-Lookup
A script that can lookup the carrier information of multiple phone numbers

This script uses Pandas to import phone numbers from an Excel workbook, then runs it through the Twilio API to check Carrier information on the numbers. It then saves the file as a JSON for further editing. This was my first project playing with APIs, and I was able to get a lot of really neat information with it!
